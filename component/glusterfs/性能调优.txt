Small file improvements in Gluster with md-cache (Experimental)
Notes for users:
With this release, metadata cache on the client side is integrated with the
cache-invalidation feature so that the clients can cache longer without
compromising on consistency. By enabling, the metadata cache and cache
invalidation feature and extending the cache timeout to 600s, we have seen
performance improvements in metadata operation like creates, ls/stat, chmod,
rename, delete. The perf improvements is significant in SMB access of gluster
volume, but as a cascading effect the improvements is also seen on FUSE/Native
access and NFS access.

Use the below options in the order mentioned, to enable the features:

gluster volume set <volname> features.cache-invalidation on
gluster volume set <volname> features.cache-invalidation-timeout 600
gluster volume set <volname> performance.stat-prefetch on
gluster volume set <volname> performance.cache-invalidation on
gluster volume set <volname> performance.cache-samba-metadata on   # Only for SMB access
gluster volume set <volname> performance.md-cache-timeout 600
